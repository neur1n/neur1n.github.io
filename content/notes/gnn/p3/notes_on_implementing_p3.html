    This note presumes that the reader has finished reading the
    <a href="https://docs.dgl.ai/tutorials/blitz/index.html">A Blitz Introduction to DGL</a>
    and the <a href="https://docs.dgl.ai/tutorials/dist/1_node_classification.html">Distributed Node Classification</a>
    documentations, and the contents are based on node classification only.

    <h2 id="data-preprocessing">Data Preprocessing</h2>
    <p>
    Before partitioning, it is crucial to ensure that the node labels in the
    DGL graph are stored for future usage:
    </p>

    <pre>
      <code>
        from dgl.distributed import partition_graph
        from ogb.nodeproppred import DglNodePropPredDataset
        import dgl

        dataset = DglNodePropPredDataset("ogbn-arxiv")

        graph, node_labels = dataset[0]
        graph = dgl.add_reverse_edges(graph)

        graph.ndata["label"] = node_labels[:, 0]
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
    It is worth noting that the current documentation does not explicitly
    outline the necessity of this step. As a result, it is easy to overlook,
    potentially leading to issues when attempting to use code copied from DGL's
    documentation, as the absence of this step can impede its functionality.
    </p>

    <h2 id="forward-pass">Forward Pass</h2>
    <p>
    There are at least two ways to implement the forward pass as P<sup>3</sup>
    does, modifying DGL's built-in class or implement a new class from scratch.
    </p>

    <h3>Modifying DGL</h3>
    <p>
    To modify DGL's classes to allow switching between model parallelism and
    data parallelism, we need to find the right position to insert scatter and
    gather operations. In DGL, the forward pass is done by calling the
    <tt>dgl.heterograph.DGLGraph.update_all</tt> function, of which the call
    stack is:
    </p>

    <pre>
      dgl.heterograph.DGLGraph.update_all
      |- dgl.core.message_passing
         |  |- dgl.core.invoke_gspmm: if message and reduce functions are both built-in
         |                            else
         |- dgl.core.invoke_gsddmm:   message
            dgl.core.invoke_gspmm:    reduce
    </pre>

    <p>
    DGL's built-in message and reduce functions are easy to re-implement which
    allows us to always perform forward pass by calling
    <tt>dgl.core.invoke_gsddmm</tt> and <tt>dgl.core.invoke_gspmm</tt>. Between
    this two functions is the position where we need to insert scatter and
    gather functions.
