    <h3>1.1 What is the problem addressed in the paper?</h3>
    <p>
      The concurrent use of multiple trees reduces the interpretability of the
      ensemble. The paper studied born-again tree (BA tree) ensembles, i.e.,
      the process of <b>constructing a single decision tree of minimum size
      that reproduces the exact same behavior as a given tree ensemble
      in its entire feature space</b>.
    </p>

    <h3>1.2 Is This a New Problem?</h3>
    <p>
      No, but the classifiers result from related works, all of which embed
      heuristic construction techniques or an approximate objective, <b>do not
      guarantee a behavior and prediction performance equal to the original
      tree ensemble or neural network</b>.
    </p>

    <h3>1.3 What is the Scientific Hypothesis That the Paper is Trying to
      Verify?</h3>
    <p>
      Hypothesis:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Given a tree ensemble \(\mathcal{T}\), a single decision tree \(T\)
          of minimal size can be found such that is faithful to \(\mathcal{T}\),
          i.e., \(F_T(x) = F_{\mathcal{T}}(\mathbf{x}), \forall\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^p\).
        </li>
      </ul>

      Definitions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          \(\mathbf{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^p\): \(p\)-dimension numerical feature
          vector
        </li>
        <li>
          \(\mathbf{y}_i \in \mathbb{N}\): \(\mathbf{x}_i\)'s associated class
        </li>
        <li>
          \((\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{y}) = \{\mathbf{x}_i, y_i\}^n_{i = 1}\):
          training set
        </li>
        <li>
          \((\mathcal{X, Y})\): an unknown distribution where samples are drawn
          from
        </li>
        <li>
          \(\mathcal{T}\): a tree ensemble as a set of trees \(t \in \mathcal{T}\)
          with weights \(w_t\)
        </li>
        <li>
          \(F_{\mathcal{T}}: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}\): a function learned
          from \(\mathcal{T}\) that predicts \(y_i\) for each \(\mathbf{x}_i\)
          drawn from \(\mathcal{X}\)
        </li>
        <li>
          \(F_{\mathcal{T}}(\mathbf{x}) = \text{WEIGHTED-MAJORITY}\{(F_t(\mathbf{x}), w_t)\}_{t \in \mathcal{T}}\):
          return of the tree ensemble for a sample \(\mathbf{x}\)
          with weights \(w_t\)
        </li>
        <li>
          \(H_j\): split hyperplanes extracted from the trees for each feature
          \(j\) for \(j \in \{1, \dots, p\}\)
        </li>
        <li>
          \(\mathcal{S}_{\text{ELEM}} = \{1, \dots, |H_1| + 1\} \times \cdots \times \{1, \dots, |H_p| + 1\}\):
          cells result from partitioning the feature space \(\mathbb{R}^p\)
        </li>
        <li>
          \(\mathbf{z} = (z_1, \dots, z_p) \in \mathcal{S}_{\text{ELEM}}\): a
          cell representing a box contained between \(H_{z_j - 1}\) and
          \(H_{z_j}\)
          <ul>
            <li>
              Cells such that \(z_j = 1\) (or \(z_j = |H_j| + 1\)) extend from
              \(-\infty\) (or to \(\infty\), respectively) along dimension \(j\)
            </li>
            <li>
              \(F_{\mathcal{T}}(\mathbf{z})\) is constant in the interior of
              each \(\mathbf{z}\)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          \((\mathbf{z}^\text{L}, \mathbf{z}^\text{R}) \in \mathcal{S}^2_{\text{ELEM}} \in \mathcal{S}_{\text{REGIONS}}\):
          a region such that \(\mathbf{z}^\text{L} \le \mathbf{z} \le \mathbf{z}^\text{R}\)
        </li>
      </ul>
