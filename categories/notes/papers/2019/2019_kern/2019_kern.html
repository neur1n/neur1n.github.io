      The distribution of real-world relationships is unbalanced, existing
      methods perform quite poorly for the less frequent relationships. In this
      work, it is found that the statistical correlations between object pairs
      and their relationships can effectively regularize semantic space and
      make prediction less ambiguous, and thus address the unbalanced
      distribution issue.

      provides a deeper understanding for the image and facilities various

      Existing methods for scene graph generation rely on target object regions
      or contextual cues to aid recognition, which require large amounts of
      annotated samples for model optimization while the distribution of
      real-world relationships is unbalanced and lead to poor performance for
      those with limited training samples.

        Both models are trained on the whole training set and evaluated on
        the two subsets, respectively. Note that SMN is the previous
        best-performing method.

      Objects in visual scene commonly have strongly structured regularities
      (according to SMN). Modeling these statistical correlations between
      object pairs and relationships can effectively regularize the semantic
      prediction space, and thus address the unbalanced distribution issue.
    </p>

    <p>
      This work introduces a novel Knowledge-Embedded Routing Network (KERN)
      capturing the interplay of target objects and their relationships under
      the explicit guidance of prior statistical knowledge and automatically
      mines contextual cues to facilitate scene graph generation.

      Existing works utilize the recall@<i>X</i> (short as R@<i>X</i>,
      referring <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/ranjaykrishna/vrd/" target="_blank">Lu, 2016</a>)
      as the evaluation metric, which  is easily dominated by the performance
      of the relationships with a large proportion of samples. As the
      distribution of different relationships is severely unbalanced, if one
      method performs well on several most frequent relationships, it can
      achieve a high R@<i>X</i> score, leading to not well measure the
      performance of all relationships. To address this issue, a mean
      recall@<i>X</i> (mR@<i>X</i>) is proposed as a complimentary evaluation
      metric. Compared with R@<i>X</i>, mR@<i>X</i> can give a more
      comprehensive performance evaluation for all relationships.

    <h3>Evaluation Metrics</h3>
    <p>
      In validation/test dataset, assume there are \(Y\) images. For each
      image, a model generates top \(X\) predicted relationship triplets. As
      for image \(I_y\), there are \(G_y\) ground truth relationship triplets,
      where \(T^X_y\) triplets are predicted successfully by the model. Then:

      $$ R@X = \frac{1}{Y} \sum^Y_{y=1} \frac{T^X_y}{G_y} $$
    </p>

    <p>
      For image \(I_y\), in its \(G_y\) ground truth relationship triplets,
      there are \(G_{yk}\) ground truth triplets with relationship \(k\)
      (Except \(k = 1\), meaning no relationship. The number of relationship
      classes is \(K\), including no relationship), where \(T^X_{yk}\) triplets
      are predicted successfully by the model. In \(Y\) images of
      validation/test dataset, for relationship \(k\), there are \(Y_k\) images
      which contain at least one ground truth triplet with this relationship.
      The R@<i>X</i> of relationship \(k\) can be calculated:

      $$ R@X_k = \frac{1}{Y_k} \sum^Y_{y=1,G_{yk} \neq 0} \frac{T^X_{yk}}{G_{yk}} $$
    </p>

    <p>
      Then mR@<i>X</i> can be calculated:

      $$ mR@X = \frac{1}{K - 1} \sum^K_{k=2} R@X_k $$
